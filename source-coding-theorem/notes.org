Exercises derived from David Mckay's information theory book 2003:


1) Define prob function.



Theorem: Shannon's source coding theorem.
    |(1/N)*H_delta(X^N) - H| < episilon

If N is very large, esential bits needed to encode is very close to 'H',
no matter what the probability of not coding x (i.e. delta).
